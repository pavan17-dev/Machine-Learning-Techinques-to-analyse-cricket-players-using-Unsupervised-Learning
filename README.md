This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of team and player performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. The dataset includes detailed information on teams, players, and their respective performances. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of teams and individual players based on their on-field performances.


Overview

This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of team and player performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022. The dataset includes detailed information on teams, players, and their respective performances. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of teams and individual players based on their on-field performances.
Key Steps:
1. Data Collection and Team/Player Analysis

    IPL 2022 Data: Collected extensive data on teams and players' performances during the IPL 2022 season.

    Performance Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses of teams and individual players. This involved statistical and strategic insights into batting, bowling, and overall gameplay.

2. Historical Player Performance Data

    Data Collection: Gathered historical performance data for players who have been active since 2020.

    Criteria for Inclusion: Focused on players with a minimum of 200 balls faced for batters and 200 balls bowled for bowlers to ensure substantial data for analysis.

3. Unsupervised Machine Learning with K-Means Clustering

    Algorithm Selection: Employed the K-Means Clustering algorithm for its ability to group similar players based on various performance metrics.

    Player Clustering: Applied K-Means Clustering to categorize players into distinct groups, providing insights into player types and playing styles.

Benefits

    Strategic Insights: Teams can use the analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of opponents, enabling strategic decision-making during matches.

    Player Profiling: The clustering results offer a nuanced understanding of player types, helping teams make informed decisions during auctions and team composition.

    Performance Benchmarking: Historical player data and clustering allow for benchmarking current players against their past performances and identifying areas for improvement.

Future Work

    Continuous updates and analysis based on ongoing IPL seasons.
    Integration of additional performance metrics and advanced analytics for more comprehensive insights.
